            <h1>Web Storage API - Local Storage</h1>
            <p>Web storage API provides a way of storing data in a browser differently than 
                when using cookies.  The localStorage property has no expiration date and will 
                remain stored in the browser even after it's been closed. It also has the 
                highest max storage limit compared to sessionStorage (in which the data is only
                stored for a session) and cookies (which has the least amount of storage space).
                <br></br>&bull; keys and values in localStorage will always be strings.
