            <p>The video tag specifies movie clips or other types of video streams.
                The supported file formats are: MP4, WebM and OGG.  MP4 is most widely used because
                it's supported by more browser types.
            </p>
            <video width="320" height="240" controls>
            <source src="../cit261/Storm_Warning.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
            
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>The audio tag defines sounds or other audio streams.  There are three supported
                file formats: MP3, WAV and OGG.  MP3 is supported on more browsers than the other
                two formats. If you place text between the opening and closing audio tags, that text 
                will be displayed only if the the user opened the page on a browser that doesn't 
                support the audio tag.  This is the same for the video and canvas tags.  You can use 
                the controls attribute to add audio controls to play, pause, adjust volume, loop, etc. 
                The audio tag defines the sound content and the source tag defines the resources for 
                the element.
            </p>
            <audio controls loop>
            <source src="../cit261/Night_Sounds_Crickets.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
            Your browser does not support the audio element.
            </audio>           
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>The canvas tag is used to draw graphics on a page via scripting.
                The element itself is only a container and in order for graphics to be displayed
                you must use a script to draw the graphics.  There's several methods for drawing 
                paths, boxes, circles, text and more. The text drawn can be animated or non-animated.
                The objects inside canvas can move.  The element can respond to user actions such as 
                hover, button clicks or mouse clicks.  The canvas element must contain an id as well 
                as a defined height and width. You may use multiple canvas elements on one page. 
                You can also style it with a border. Canvas is a two dimensional grid and the upper
                left corner's coordinates are (0, 0). Some methods that can be easily used are moveTo(), 
                lineTo(), beginPath() and arc().  The first two allow you to draw a line with a starting 
                and end point.  The second two allow you to draw a circle by starting the path and 
                another to determine the size.
