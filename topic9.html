            <h1>Events</h1>
            <p>HTML events are things that happen to HTML elements.  It can be something the 
            user does themselves, or something the broser does.  Javascript is able 
            to react on the events. Event handlers make it so things happen when: a page loads,    
            a button is clicked, the user inputs data, an object is moused over, you touch 
            something on your mobile device, and many other things. 
            </p>
            <p>Methods are also used in order to allow the JavaScript to work with the events.  Event
            attributes can call JavaScript functions, execute JavaScript code directly and impact  
            how the events are handled or sent, to name a few. 
            </p>
            <p>An Event would be something like the following:
            <br></br>
            &bull; onchange - when an element has changed
            &bull; onclick - when a user clicks an element
            &bull; onload - when the browser has fully loaded
            &bull; onmouseover - when the mouse is moved over an element
            </p>
            <p>Some Examples:</p>
            <button onclick="displayDate()">Tell Me The Date & Time</button>
            <p id="date"></p>
        </div>
    </main>
</body>
